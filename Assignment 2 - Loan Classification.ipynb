    "First we must make the two datasets compatible. We discard features that don't apply to both rejected and accepted loan requests. We discard state information since the information is inherent in the zipcode data. Leaving the state information in would help us estimate predictions for datapoints in rare zipcodes, but will also tend to hide differences between zipcodes inside a given state, which we predict to be salient and useful. We represent the zipcodes as dummy variables to make sure we don't assume a linear relationship between zip code numbers. We discard the loan title, since no unified titling standard was used to help us easily compare different categories, and most titles are unique. We can also discard the policy code, since it's invariant across the rejected sample. We found no analogous field for risk/credit scores in the approved dataset, so we discard risk score. Hopefully debt-to-income ration would covariate and capture that information by proxy. While our dataset is limited and not fully similar in the range of dates, we can better extrapolate to dates not covered by the dataset by considering the seasonal trends divorced from specific years. Since one of our datasets does not provide exact dates, we only preserve the month the request was made. We also want to use the relationship between employment lengths for different applicants, without information on lengths shorter than a year or longer than 9. We approximate less than a year to a zero, and while the average employment length for applicants with 10 or more years of experience is probably much higher than 10, guessing a value would be risky and they are rare enough that we can safely set their employment length at 10 years.\n",
    "This leaves us with the features:\n",
    "- Amount Requested\n",
    "- Application Date (month*)\n",
    "- Debt-To-Income Ratio\n",
    "- Zip Code (as dummy variables)\n",
    "- Employment Length (0-10)\n",
    "\n",
    "*To best represent the cyclical nature of the yearly cycle, we convert the month values to two variables capturing sin and cos. This way Dec and Jan are as similar as Jan and Feb."
